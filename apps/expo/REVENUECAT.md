# RevenueCat Implementation Tracker

**Project**: T3 Turbo Expo App  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-13  
**Status**: üîÑ Debug Phase - Native Build Paywall Not Displaying  
**Platform Focus**: ü§ñ Android First

## üö¶ Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed - RevenueCat Dashboard Configuration
- [x] **RevenueCat Template**: Created and configured ‚úÖ
- [x] **Entitlements**: "Premium" entitlement configured ‚úÖ
- [x] **Products**: Products created and configured ‚úÖ
- [x] **Offerings**: Offerings created and configured ‚úÖ
- [x] RevenueCat SDK connected and configured
- [x] Dependencies installed (`react-native-purchases@9.1.0`, `react-native-purchases-ui@9.1.0`)
- [x] RevenueCat provider setup (`src/features/subscriptions/providers/revenuecat-provider.tsx`)
- [x] Basic paywall component created (`src/app/(tabs)/profile/revenuecat-paywall.tsx`)

### ‚úÖ Completed - Build & Testing Setup
- [x] EAS build completed and uploaded to Google Play Console
- [x] Internal testing setup with testers added
- [x] Native build testing environment ready

### ‚ùå Current Issue - Native Build Problem
- **Problem**: "SHOW PAYWALL" button pressed but nothing displays in Android native build
- **Environment**: Google Play Console internal testing (native build)
- **Expected**: RevenueCat paywall template should appear

### üîÑ Next Steps - Native Build Debug Focus
- [ ] Verify template is published/active in RevenueCat dashboard
- [ ] Confirm Android API key is correctly configured
- [ ] Check Google Play Console product linking to RevenueCat
- [ ] Add console logging to debug native build paywall flow
- [ ] Verify offering is set as "current" in RevenueCat dashboard

### Key Components

#### RevenueCat Provider (`revenuecat-provider.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Initialize RevenueCat SDK
- **Features**: Platform-specific API keys, logging configuration
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented

#### Paywall Component (`revenuecat-paywall.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Display paywall and handle purchase flow
- **Features**: `presentPaywallIfNeeded` with "Premium" entitlement
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Not displaying paywall

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Required environment variables
EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_API_KEY_IOS=xxx
EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_API_KEY_ANDROID=xxx
```

## üêõ Debug Information

### Enhanced Debug Tools Added ‚úÖ
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Both provider and paywall component now have detailed debug logs
- **Debug UI**: New debug interface in paywall component with multiple test buttons
- **Customer Info Checking**: Real-time customer info and entitlement status
- **Offerings Verification**: Check available products and offerings
- **Force Paywall Option**: Test paywall display even if user has entitlement

### Known RevenueCat Limitations
- ‚ùå Paywall templates don't work in Expo Go
- ‚úÖ Requires native build (EAS) for testing
- ‚úÖ Google Play Console internal testing setup required

### Systematic Debug Checklist for Native Build

#### 1. **RevenueCat Dashboard Verification** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **Products**: Created in RevenueCat dashboard
- [x] **Entitlements**: "Premium" entitlement exists and linked to products  
- [x] **Offerings**: Offerings created and configured
- [x] **Paywall Template**: Created in RevenueCat dashboard
- [ ] **Template Status**: Verify template is PUBLISHED/ACTIVE
- [ ] **Current Offering**: Confirm offering is set as "CURRENT"

#### 2. **Android-Specific Configuration**
- [ ] **Android API Key**: Verify `EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_API_KEY_ANDROID` is correct
- [ ] **Google Play Link**: Products linked to Google Play Console
- [ ] **Product IDs**: Match RevenueCat product identifiers exactly
- [ ] **Google Play Status**: Products are active/published in Google Play Console
- [ ] **App Bundle ID**: Google Play app matches RevenueCat app configuration

#### 3. **Native Build Console Logging** (Priority Debug)
- [ ] **Provider Logs**: Check RevenueCat initialization logs
- [ ] **API Key**: Confirm Android API key found and configured  
- [ ] **Customer Info**: Verify customer info retrieved successfully
- [ ] **Offerings Count**: Should show count > 0
- [ ] **Current Offering**: Should identify current offering
- [ ] **Paywall Result**: Log the exact result from `presentPaywallIfNeeded`

#### 4. **Common Android Native Build Issues**
- [ ] **Offering Not Current**: Most common cause - offering not set as current
- [ ] **Template Not Published**: Template exists but not published/active
- [ ] **API Key Mismatch**: Wrong or missing Android API key
- [ ] **Google Play Sync**: Products not properly synced between RevenueCat and Google Play
- [ ] **Build Configuration**: Release vs debug build configuration differences

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### **Native Build Paywall Not Displaying - Focused Root Causes:**

**Since your dashboard is configured, focus on these issues:**

1. **Offering Not Set as "CURRENT"** ‚ö†Ô∏è Most Likely Cause
   - **Symptoms**: Template exists, products exist, but paywall doesn't show
   - **Fix**: In RevenueCat dashboard ‚Üí Offerings ‚Üí Set your offering as "Current Offering"
   - **Check**: Look for "Current" label next to your offering

2. **Template Not PUBLISHED/ACTIVE** 
   - **Symptoms**: Template created but not live
   - **Fix**: In RevenueCat dashboard ‚Üí Paywalls ‚Üí Ensure template status is "Published"
   - **Check**: Template should show "Published" status, not "Draft"

3. **Android API Key Issues**
   - **Symptoms**: Provider logs show Android API key errors
   - **Fix**: Verify `EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_API_KEY_ANDROID` in environment
   - **Check**: Console logs should show "RevenueCat configured successfully for android"

4. **Google Play Console Product Sync**
   - **Symptoms**: RevenueCat can't find Google Play products
   - **Fix**: Ensure product IDs match exactly between RevenueCat and Google Play Console
   - **Check**: Product identifiers must be identical (case-sensitive)

5. **User Already Has Premium Entitlement**
   - **Symptoms**: `presentPaywallIfNeeded` returns `NOT_PRESENTED`
   - **Fix**: Test with fresh user or use `presentPaywall()` instead
   - **Check**: Console logs should show entitlement status

### Debug Log Patterns to Watch For:

**‚úÖ Successful Initialization:**
```
üöÄ [RevenueCat] Starting initialization...
üîë [RevenueCat] API key found: rcat_xxx...
‚úÖ [RevenueCat] Configured successfully for android
üë§ [RevenueCat] Customer ID: $RCAnonymousID:xxx
üõçÔ∏è [RevenueCat] Available offerings: 1
üì¶ [RevenueCat] Current offering: default with 2 packages
```

**‚ùå Problem Indicators:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è [RevenueCat] No current offering found
‚ùå [RevenueCat] Available offerings: 0
‚ùå [RevenueCat] No API key found
üí• [RevenueCat] Configuration failed
```

## üîß Development Workflow

### EAS Build Process
```bash
# Build for internal testing
eas build --platform android --profile development
```

### Testing Process
1. Upload build to Google Play Console
2. Add internal testers
3. Download and install APK
4. Test paywall functionality
5. Monitor logs for errors

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check build logs
eas build:view [build-id]

# Check device logs
adb logcat | grep RevenueCat
```
