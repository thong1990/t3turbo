### Systematic Debug Checklist for Native Build

#### 1. **RevenueCat Dashboard Verification** ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Products**: Created in RevenueCat dashboard
- [x] **Entitlements**: "Premium" entitlement exists and linked to products  
- [x] **Offerings**: Offerings created and configured
- [x] **Paywall Template**: Created in RevenueCat dashboard
- [x] **Template Status**: ✅ **PUBLISHED** - Template is active
- [x] **Current Offering**: ✅ **CURRENT** - Offering "default" is set as current

**Verified Offering Details**:
- **Identifier**: default
- **RevenueCat ID**: ofrng4b5334e66d  
- **Package Identifiers**: rc_annual, rc_monthly (RevenueCat internal)
- **Subscription IDs**: premium_yearly, premium_monthly (Google Play)
- **Status**: Current offering ✅
- **Configuration**: ✅ All correctly configured and linked

#### 2. **Android-Specific Configuration** 
- [x] **Android API Key**: ✅ **VERIFIED** - `goog_WFMZBvxnKhlWgglzHnvPScdbFoA`
- [x] **Google Play Link**: ✅ **VERIFIED** - Products linked to Google Play Console
- [x] **Product IDs**: ✅ **VERIFIED** - Match exactly: `premium_yearly`, `premium_monthly`
- [x] **Google Play Status**: ✅ **VERIFIED** - Products are ACTIVE in Google Play Console
- [x] **App Bundle ID**: ✅ **VERIFIED** - Google Play app matches RevenueCat app configuration

**✅ CONFIGURATION VERIFIED**: All RevenueCat dashboard configuration is correct:
- Package IDs (rc_annual/rc_monthly) properly map to Google Play Subscriptions (premium_yearly/premium_monthly)
- Offering contains correct packages and is set as current
- All products are active and properly linked

#### 3. **Native Build Console Logging** (Priority Debug)
- [ ] **Provider Logs**: Check RevenueCat initialization logs
- [ ] **API Key**: Confirm Android API key found and configured  
- [ ] **Customer Info**: Verify customer info retrieved successfully
- [ ] **Offerings Count**: Should show count > 0
- [ ] **Current Offering**: Should identify current offering
- [ ] **Paywall Result**: Log the exact result from `presentPaywallIfNeeded`

#### 4. **RevenueCat Configuration Issues** - ✅ ALL RESOLVED
- [x] ~~**Offering Not Current**~~ ✅ **RESOLVED** - offering "default" is current
- [x] ~~**Template Not Published**~~ ✅ **RESOLVED** - template is published/active  
- [x] ~~**API Key Mismatch**~~ ✅ **RESOLVED** - Android API key verified
- [x] ~~**Google Play Sync**~~ ✅ **RESOLVED** - Products correctly linked
- [x] ~~**Offering Product Assignment**~~ ✅ **RESOLVED** - Package IDs correctly map to subscriptions

#### 5. **Remaining Debug Areas**
- [ ] **🚨 User Entitlement State** - User may already have Premium entitlement
- [ ] **Build Configuration** - Debug vs release build differences  
- [ ] **Paywall Method** - Try `presentPaywall()` instead of `presentPaywallIfNeeded()`

**Current Focus**: Test different paywall presentation methods and check user entitlement state

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### **Native Build Paywall Not Displaying - FINAL STATUS:**

**✅ ALL CONFIGURATION ISSUES RESOLVED:**

1. ~~**Offering Not Set as "CURRENT"**~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**
2. ~~**Template Not PUBLISHED/ACTIVE**~~ ✅ **RESOLVED** 
3. ~~**Android API Key Issues**~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**
4. ~~**Google Play Console Product Sync**~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**
5. ~~**Offering Product Assignment**~~ ✅ **RESOLVED** - Package IDs correctly map to subscriptions

**🚨 REMAINING LIKELY CAUSES:**

1. **User Already Has Premium Entitlement** ⚠️ **MOST LIKELY**
   - **Symptoms**: `presentPaywallIfNeeded` returns `NOT_PRESENTED` 
   - **Reason**: If user already has Premium access, paywall won't show
   - **Test**: Try `presentPaywall()` instead (bypasses entitlement check)
   - **Solution**: Use fresh test user or check current entitlement status

2. **Build/Timing Issues**
   - **Symptoms**: Configuration correct but paywall still not displaying
   - **Possible**: App needs restart after configuration changes
   - **Test**: Clean install of updated build

**RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:** Add debug logging and test with `presentPaywall()` method

### Debug Log Patterns to Watch For:

**✅ Successful Initialization:**
```
🚀 [RevenueCat] Starting initialization...
🔑 [RevenueCat] API key found: rcat_xxx...
✅ [RevenueCat] Configured successfully for android
👤 [RevenueCat] Customer ID: $RCAnonymousID:xxx
🛍️ [RevenueCat] Available offerings: 1
📦 [RevenueCat] Current offering: default with 2 packages
```

**❌ Problem Indicators:**
```
⚠️ [RevenueCat] No current offering found
❌ [RevenueCat] Available offerings: 0
❌ [RevenueCat] No API key found
💥 [RevenueCat] Configuration failed
```
